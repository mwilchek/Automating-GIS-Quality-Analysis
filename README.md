# Automating-GIS-Quality-Analysis

This is a repo to hold related python programs to automate quality analysis with large geo-spatial datasets.

This first folder of files is for a working program that will ingest the data from an Oracle database, load into a ETL process, write to a empty geo-database, perform quality analysis if the right structure points are in the right polygons, and then output a file of results.

Currently developing a second program that will do something similiar, but instead of structure points; address ranges...
